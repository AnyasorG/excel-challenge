**Title:** Analysis of Factors Influencing Crowdfunding Reception Trends

**Executive Summary:** This data analysis report aims to evaluate crowdfunding reception trends by analyzing a dataset of 1000 sample crowdfunding projects. The primary objective is to uncover patterns and trends within this dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of crowdfunding reception.

## Introduction

Crowdfunding has become a popular means of funding creative projects and businesses in their initial stage to avoid resort to bank financing sources (Mora-Cruz & Palos-Sanchez, 2023). To better understand what factors and trends influence crowdfunding reception, an analysis of a dataset containing 1000 sample crowdfunding projects was performed.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis consists of 1000 sample crowdfunding projects excel file and can be downloaded as a .zip file from [here](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m1/lms/starter/Starter_Code.zip). The data is sourced from various crowdfunding campaigns and represents a diverse range of projects as prepared by edX Boot Camps LLC. All codes were obtained from [here](https://exceljet.net/formulas).

## Data Analysis Strategy

The analysis strategy involved the following steps:
i. Creation of a project space called excel-challenge on Google Drive to facilitate data storage and sharing.
ii. Downloaded the provided Excel database in .zip format.
iii. Utilized the Excel workbook contained in the downloaded folder to analyze sample-project data and discover market trends.
iv. Employed conditional formatting tools to identify trends and patterns.
v. Created pivot tables and pivot charts to visualize the data effectively.

## Results

Data analysis yielded the following insights regarding crowdfunding campaign reception:

1. **Theater Category Success:** Data showed that the theater category, specifically the "plays" subcategory, had the highest number of successful campaigns, surpassing other categories. This indicates the relative success of theater projects in achieving funding goals (Figure 1 and 2; Pivot Table 1 and 2).

2. **Effective Campaign Months:** The analysis revealed that campaigns staged in specific months, namely January, March, June, and June, showed higher success rates. This suggests that campaign strategies should be strategically timed to these months for improved effectiveness.

3. **August Cancellations and Failures:** The dataset showed a notable spike in the number of canceled and failed projects in the month of August, with 8 cancellations and 35 failures. Understanding the reasons behind this August spike is crucial for enhancing project management and identifying potential issues specific to that month (Pivot Table 3).

## Limitations of the Dataset

While the dataset is valuable, it has several limitations:
i. **Lack of Qualitative Data:** The dataset only provides quantitative data on project outcomes. Qualitative data, such as customer feedback, reasons for cancellation, or internal post-mortem reports, is essential for a deeper understanding of project performance.

ii. **Ambiguity in Live Projects:** The live category in the dataset lacks information about the status and progress of these projects, making it unclear whether they are on track to success or facing challenges.

iii. **Data Quality Concerns:** Without details on data collection and cleaning processes, there may concern about data accuracy and quality.

iv. **Unexplained Categorical Variables:** Some variables, such as "staff_pick" and "spotlight," are represented as Boolean values without clear explanations of their meanings.

v. **Currency Variability:** The dataset includes various currencies (CAD, USD, GBP, EUR, AUD, CHF, and DKK) with a lack of currency conversion for financial analysis and comparisons.

vi. **Geographical Bias:** The dataset includes projects from specific countries, potentially introducing geographical bias in the sample.

## Tool Used

**Microsoft Excel** was the primary tool utilized for data analysis in this project. Excel was chosen for its versatility in handling and analyzing large datasets, creating pivot tables and charts, and employing conditional formatting for data visualization.

The use of Excel facilitated data exploration, trend identification, and statistical analysis, making it a valuable tool for gaining insights from the dataset of 1000 sample crowdfunding projects.
